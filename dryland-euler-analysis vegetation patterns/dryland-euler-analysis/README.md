# Dryland Euler Analysis

This project analyzes vegetation patterns in dryland satellite images using the Euler characteristic across thresholds.

## Structure

- `dryland_euler_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis pipeline.
- `images/`: Place your input images here.
- `output/`: Output graphs and text files will be saved here.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Add satellite images to `images/` folder.
3. Open and run the notebook `dryland_euler_analysis.ipynb`.
